    <h1>IP Info - Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>IP Info ("the App") is designed to help users look up information about IP addresses and domain names. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>IP Addresses and Domains You Look Up:</strong> When you use the App to look up an IP address or domain name, this query is sent to our third-party API provider (ipapi.co) to retrieve the information. We do not store these queries on our servers.</p>

    <p><strong>Your IP Address:</strong> When you use the "My IP Address" feature, your current IP address is determined by the third-party API service. This information is displayed to you but is not stored by us.</p>

    <p><strong>Search History:</strong> The App stores your recent search history locally on your device only. This data is not transmitted to any server and remains entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses ipapi.co to retrieve IP address information. Their privacy policy can be found at: <a href="https://ipapi.co/privacy/">https://ipapi.co/privacy/</a></p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All user preferences and search history are stored locally on your device using iOS's standard storage mechanisms. No personal data is transmitted to or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. The only data shared is the IP address or domain name you choose to look up, which is sent to ipapi.co to fulfill your request.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
    <p>Email: martinycleung@gmail.com</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can clear your local search history at any time within the App by using the "Clear All" button in the History view. Since we don't store any data on our servers, there is no additional data to request or delete.</p>
